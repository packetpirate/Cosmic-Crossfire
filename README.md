### Description

Cosmic Crossfire is a twist on a traditional bullet hell game where the player has no weapons. Instead, the enemy weapons have friendly fire, so you must dodge their projectiles and attempt to maneuver in a way that the enemies destroy themselves.

Cosmic Crossfire is being created during the Space Jam Game Jam hosted by UMass Lowell's Game Development Club. This game will be created in 48 hours from scratch.
